# FAQ

### Help, I cannot navigate to the "paid" invoices tab
You probably haven't scanned your first invoice yet. Select the "+" button on the main screen to add one.



### Can I add bills with multiple pages?
If you want to try this, we'd love to hear from you. This feature is currently planned for development.



### Can i add bills from my email?
At the moment, BillReminder only scans directly from the iPhone camera and photo library. If you want reminders for bills that were emailed to you, try photographing it off the screen (it works a treat, we promise).



### Which iOS versions and devices do you support?
BillReminder runs on iOS 12 and 13, on every iPhone series device from model 6s upwards. We do not currently support the iPad, watch, or tvOS.



### I accidentally turned off app permissions for camera and/or notifications, how do i get it back?
Follow the prompts on the BillReminder UI, or open the "Settings" app on your phone, then scroll down until you find BillReminder. Turn on Notifications and Camera here, easy.



### Can I pay my bills directly in BillReminder?
Unfortunately not, however if you have are seriously interested, please raise an issue or upvote the existing one.



### Can i pinch to zoom bills so i can read them better?
This is work in progress, please be patient.
